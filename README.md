# WhatsApp-Chat-Analyzer

WhatsApp Chat Analysis project focuses on analyzing exported chat data to extract meaningful insights. It provides an overall analysis for both group and individual chats, highlighting key metrics such as the most active user. The project visualizes the data through various graphs and charts, making it easy to interpret patterns and trends in communication.

I implemented the project in Python, leveraging TF-IDF vectorization for data processing and analysis. For the user interface, I used Streamlit to create an interactive and user-friendly frontend. Finally, the project was deployed on Render to make it accessible online. This combination of tools and technologies showcases my ability to handle data analysis, visualization, and deployment effectively.
